I am a **Ph.D. Candidate** at the Département de Génie Informatique et Génie Logiciel (Department of Computer and Software Engineering) at [Polytechnique Montréal](https://www.polymtl.ca) ([Université de Montréal](https://www.umontreal.ca/)), Montréal, Canada, under the supervision of [_Dr. Bentley Oakes_](https://www.polymtl.ca/expertises/oakes-bentley).

My research focuses on **the use of machine learning (ML) approaches to accelerate the construction of digital twins (DT) for complex cyber-physical systems**. The goal is to minimise the cognitive and time effort for constructing these systems, while still maximize the insights gained during the digital engineering process.

My main research interests include:
* digital twins, their structures and construction process
* model and ontology driven engineering techniques
* application of machine learning in cyber-physical systems
* real time data processing and recommendation systems
* evolutionary computing

In 2023 received an _M.Eng. (Industrial Engineering)_ from [Stellenbosch University](https://www.sun.ac.za/english), Stellenbosch, South Africa. 
I graduated top of the class with distinction (**cum laude**). The degree has a specialization focus in _Data Science_. 
My thesis was titled: **An Evolutionary Algorithm for the Vehicle Routing Problem with Drones with Interceptions (VRPDi)**, under the supervision of [_Prof. Jacomine Grobler_](https://scholar.google.co.za/citations?user=_Fm9-S8AAAAJ&hl=en).

Before that, in 2019 I received a _Master of Business Administration (MBA)_ from [Regent Business School](https://regent.ac.za/), Johannesburg, South Africa.
My research project was titled: **Exploring the effects of mergers and acquisitions on employee job satisfaction:
A case study of Reservations Request Inc., KwaZulu-Natal**, under the supervision of _Dr. George Hove_.

From 2012 to 2016, I attended the prestigious [Tshwane University of Technology](https://www.tut.ac.za/), Pretoria, South Africa.
Received a _B.Tech. (Computer Engineering)_. I held an internship as part of a co-operative program between the university and the [Pretoria Innovation Lab](https://www.theinnovationhub.com/).
