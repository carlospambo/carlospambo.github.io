I am a **Ph.D. student** in the département de génie informatique et génie logiciel (department of computer and software engineering) at [Polytechnique Montréal](https://www.polymtl.ca), affiliated with [Université de Montréal](https://www.umontreal.ca/), Montréal, Canada. 
My research is supervised by [_Dr. Bentley Oakes_](https://www.polymtl.ca/expertises/oakes-bentley). My research focuses on leveraging machine learning (ML) approaches to accelerate the construction of digital twins (DT) for complex cyber-physical systems.
The aim is to minimize the cognitive and time-intensive efforts required for their development while maximizing the insights gained during the digital engineering process.

My research interests include:
* Digital twins: structure and construction processes
* Model-driven and ontology-driven engineering techniques
* Machine learning applications in cyber-physical systems
* Real-time data processing and recommendation systems
* Evolutionary computing

In 2023, I earned an  _M.Eng. (Industrial Engineering)_ from [Stellenbosch University](https://www.sun.ac.za/english), Stellenbosch, South Africa, graduating **_cum laude (with distinction)_** as the top student in my class. 
My degree specialized in _Data Science_, and my thesis, supervised by [_Prof. Jacomine Grobler_](https://scholar.google.co.za/citations?user=_Fm9-S8AAAAJ&hl=en), was titled: **An Evolutionary Algorithm for the Vehicle Routing Problem with Drones with Interceptions (VRPDi)**.
