I am a **Ph.D Candidate** at the [Département de génie informatique et génie logiciel (Department of Computer and Software Engineering)](https://www.polymtl.ca/gigl/) at Polytechnique Montréal, Canada.

My research focuses on **enabling domain experts to efficiently capture and utilise their knowledge through a model-driven approach, to support digital engineering for complex cyber-physical systems**. The goal is to minimise the cognitive and time effort for constructing these systems, while still maximising the insights gained during the digital engineering process.

My main research interests include:
* digital twins, including their structure and construction
* representations of domain-specific knowledge, such as ontologies and ontological reasoning
* verification and validation of cyber-physical systems, including formal verification
* the application of machine learning to cyber-physical systems
* model-driven engineering techniques
* model transformations and their verification

In 2023 received an _MEng (Industrial Engineering)_, with a specialization in data science from the [Stellenbosch University](https://www.sun.ac.za/english) in Stellenbosch, South Africa. **An Evolutionary Algorithm for the Vehicle Routing Problem with Drones with Interceptions** was the research topic of this master, having graduated top of the class with distinction (**cum laude**).

Before that, in 2019 I received a _Master of Business Administration (MBA)_ from [Regent Business School](https://regent.ac.za/) in Johannesburg, South Africa. May research topic was **Exploring the effects of mergers and acquisitions on employee job satisfaction: A case study of Reservations Request Inc., KwaZulu-Natal**.

From 2012 to 2016, I attended the prestigious [Tshwane University of Technology](https://www.tut.ac.za/) in Pretoria, South Africa. Studying _BTech: IT_, specializing in Intelligent Industrial Systems. I held an internship as part of a co-operative program between the university and [Pretoria Inovation Lab](https://www.theinnovationhub.com/).
