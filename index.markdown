I am a **PhD (Engineering) candidate** at the [Département de génie informatique et génie logiciel (Department of Computer and Software Engineering)](https://www.polymtl.ca/gigl/) at Polytechnique Montréal (Université de Montréal), Montréal, Canada, under the supervisor of [_Dr. Bentley Oakes_](https://www.polymtl.ca/expertises/oakes-bentley).

My research focuses on **the use of machine learning (ML) and low-code approaches to accelerate the construction of digital twins (DT) for complex cyber-physical systems**. The goal is to minimise the cognitive and time effort for constructing these systems, while still maximize the insights gained during the digital engineering process.

My main research interests include:
* digital twins, their structures and construction process
* formal verification and validation of cyber-physical systems
* application of machine learning in cyber-physical systems
* model and ontology driven engineering techniques
* evolutionary computing

In 2023 received a _Master of Engineering (MEng): Industrial Engineering_ from [Stellenbosch University](https://www.sun.ac.za/english), Stellenbosch, South Africa. 
I graduated top of the class with distinction (**cum laude**). The degree had a specialization in _data science_. My thesis was titled: **An Evolutionary Algorithm for the Vehicle Routing Problem with Drones with Interceptions**, under the supervision of [_Prof. Jacomine Grobler_](https://scholar.google.co.za/citations?user=_Fm9-S8AAAAJ&hl=en).

Before that, in 2019 I received a _Master of Business Administration (MBA)_ from [Regent Business School](https://regent.ac.za/), Johannesburg, South Africa.
My research topic was **Exploring the effects of mergers and acquisitions on employee job satisfaction:
A case study of Reservations Request Inc., KwaZulu-Natal**, under the supervision of _Dr. George Hove_.

From 2012 to 2016, I attended the prestigious [Tshwane University of Technology](https://www.tut.ac.za/), Pretoria, South Africa.
Studying _Bachelor of Technology (BTech): Computer Engineering_, specializing in _Intelligent Industrial Systems_.
I held an internship as part of a co-operative program between the university and [Pretoria Inovation Lab](https://www.theinnovationhub.com/).
